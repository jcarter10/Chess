Running:
To run the project, simply run the MainPlayer class and choose one of the 3 options. The custom and bot game are self explanatory they both run on same GUI.
If an online game is chosen though then it will start up the server and wait until a guest is connected. If running project locally on one machine just simply
run the GuestPlayer class to connect to the server and then there should be two GUIs where one is for the server and one is
for the client and you can play a full fledged chess match. If running on two different computers, simply change the IP and run it
the same as above except the GuestPlayer will be ran on the other computer obviously.

Some Notes:
Built and tested in Eclipse, not sure if it will work with every other IDE (I tested with JGrasp but my graphics wouldn't show up, so safest bet is Eclipse).
I have not tested it in the command prompt.

Known Issues:
- Some problems with stalemate.
- Castling in an online game and bot game messes up the turns.
