***NOT IMPORTANT***
- Progress notes I was taking while creating this project.

7/20:
- Create main frame.
- Create ChessBoard.java to create board.
- Set chess board.

7/21:
- Set pieces position/images/color.
- Create Piece.java, parent class for all piece classes.
- Create Pawn.java

7/22: 
- get basic movement for pieces.
- fixed problem with board creation.

  
7/24:
- fixed pawn movement
- fixed layout of JFrame (added borderlayout, so
  we can add header buttons and textPanes)
- added labels for each row and column (1-8 & a-h)

7/26:
- Create Header.java, to take care of info in
  top JPanel.
- set up a selected piece text pane for header
  (will help with finding errors also).
- Error: when creating a Header class object
    in ChessBoard... It's making all the JPanels show
    up blank. 
- Fixed: instead of creating an object, just set
  all the values as globals so I can access them anywhere.
  (probably not the best solution) 
  

8/1:
- fix the number images for gridlayout, maybe
  use gridbaglayout instead? more variety, gridlayout
  isn't letting me set the size of the buttons.
- Making it so that Pieces can take other pieces.

8/5 to 8/15:
- Finish Pawn.java, need to set its rules for moving
  and taking.
- Finish Queen.java
- Finish some of King.java (only movement no rules like checks)

- Black taking pieces works fine, but with white
   there are errors. (fixed)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Coming back to finish this for Network Programming Project:
2021:

2/28:
- Fixed some bad/lazy coding.
- Rook.java. (not castling).

2/31:
- Knight.java.
- Bishop.java.

3/1:
- fix Queen.java. 
- King.java (need to implement check/checkmate). 
- check system.
**Something to figure out checkmate.
**Maybe check all the squares that the king can go 
to and simulate if the king can go there or not. But then
idk how to figure out moving other pieces to block the check.
Fix:
1) When the king puts itself in check.
2) Moving another piece in front of king to block the check.


3/3:
- fixed the check system.
*Cant put your own piece in check now.
*Can block a check with your own pieces now.
*Check errors are fixed.
*Code looks alot better and simpler.


3/4:
- castling.
*After I castle there are alot of errors.
*something with turn counter is messed up.
Fixed^^, castling is done.

Fixing Problems:
- if taking a piece that puts you in check. We already
have that implemented for an empty cell, but now
we need to implement it so that if we take a piece
that puts us in check it resets the move.
fixed^^
- if in check and you try to castle, it deletes the rook.
Need to make it so that it doesnt let you.
fixed^^
- if in check and trying to do a VALID castle, 
it messes up.
fixed^^

3/22:
Custom game capability is fully done (where you play against yourself)
  
  
--------------------------------------------------------
Starting Online capability:
initial idea, user clicks button online --> creates server, waits for client to connect (if not brings it back to home screen --> 
both GUI's pop up for each side when connection is established --> sends the move data to eachother --> makes moves on each screen depending on that data.

3/23:
Finally starting to code socket server (MainPlayer.java) and client (GuestPlayer.java) using TCP
Changing MainPlayer.java to the main class to be ran instead of HomePage.java
*Problem with running HomePage inside of MainPlayer, EventQueues are null? (fixed)

3/25:
MainPlayer not setting onlinegame to online? (fixed)
Something is wrong with the server/client, should be simple but both sides are not recieving data, could be an instance 
issue because were calling a function to create a server from a different class. (fixed)

3/26:
Try to get Guestplayer to read one move from the Mainplayer as a start (say MainPlayer will always be white)

3/28:
setting/fixing code inside of chessboard.java so that it sends the move data between main and guest. 
Was able to send data to client through a function, but when trying to read data through a function I'm getting errors (i think it's due to the 2 different ChessBoard Objects being created)

*Can't just use globals to send data cause then it wouldnt be socket programming and wouldnt work for different IPs (fixed)

3/29 to 3/31:
setting the right code for the opponent to copy the move from main on the board.
*Why doesnt the valid function work? it should work.. (fixed) 
*Works perfectly for 1 turn.

4/1 to 4/5:
Updating it to work for the entire game. (done) 
*Alot of code is messed up because of this addition.
*Was having a listener issue for the action performed function when the buttons are clicked, due to bad coding. Fixed my code
to use SwingUtilities invokeLater for the gui so that the server/client can run in the background on a different thread than the GUI. (fixed)

4/5 to 4/10:
additions: cleaning up code, modifying the socket, logger filer, etc.

4/12 to 4/15 before submission:
- creating project report
- bug testing

Additions:
- Added a logger file that records the server and client information as well as the moves in the game. (done)
- Added something so that the client can run its program before the server but sits in a while loop testing the socket to
see if its open (done)

Known Issues:
- Fixed turn counter for guest. (fixed)
- Fixing timers for online game (fixed)
- buttons are not visible when starting frame, have to hover over them for them to show. (fixed)
- When switching to blackside, same problem as the one above, it doesnt switch until I click something on screen. (fixed)
- Bot game doesnt work if I pick blackside.
- bot game castling is broken, same as online game (only sometimes)
- bot and online game draw and resign is weird.


future:
- bot capability: hard mode (full on ai)
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/ - helpful read if wanting to incorporate an AI
- fix bad coding
